# Nim-Game
Nim is an ancient two player game with many variants. This variant has a row of 3 squares, 5 squares, and 7 squares. Both players take turns crossing off squares until there is one circle left, whoever crosses off the last circle loses. Note: This app was my first attempt at learning android development with android studio and was made primarily for learning purposes.
